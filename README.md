# Portfolio Rebalancer

This project is a tool to help you rebalance your investment portfolio.

## Running the application

### Terminal (Sample)

A small sample can be run directly from the terminal:

```bash
python portfolio.py
```

This will demonstrate the core rebalancing logic with a predefined portfolio.

### Streamlit UI

To start the interactive user interface, run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Using the UI

The Streamlit UI allows you to interact with the portfolio rebalancer in a more visual way.

1.  **Enter your portfolio:** In the sidebar, you can input your current portfolio holdings. For each holding, specify the ticker symbol, the number of shares, and the current price.
2.  **Define target allocation:** Below the portfolio input, you can define your desired asset allocation for each ticker in percentages. The total allocation must sum to 100%.
3.  **Rebalance:** Once your portfolio and target allocations are set, click the "Rebalance" button.
4.  **View the plan:** The application will display a rebalancing plan, showing you which assets to buy or sell to reach your target allocation.

## Development Notes

*   This project was developed in the Windsurf AI development environment.
*   Code completion was assisted by GPT-4.1.
*   No prompting to external chat LLMs was necessary for the development of this project.
*   The inspiration for the Streamlit UI was taken from other applications built by the author.
*   This README file was generated by an AI assistant through the Windsurf AI environment.

### Future Enhancements

For simplicity, this version of the application does not include integration with live market data from sources like Yahoo Finance. This could be a potential future enhancement to automatically fetch current prices.
